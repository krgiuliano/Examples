//Abstraction is related to this lab because we don't know exactly what is behind both the Car and the Truck objects but we know what it wants from us.
//Encapsulation is related to the lab through the methods such as the displayVehicle(), displayTruck(), and displayCar(); methods.
//Inheritance is related to this lab because the Car and Truck objects extend the main class of Vehicle for some of their Properties.
